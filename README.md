# Hello Docker!
>Docker - Build, Ship, and Run Any App, Anywhere

>Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications, whether on laptops, data center VMs, or the cloud.

>In Dockerland, there are Registries, images and there are containers. The three are closely intertwined, but distinct.

At first, Docker seems intimidating. This stash repo and the accompanying [docker blog posts series](http://jmkhael.hopto.org/tag/docker/) would introduce us into the whale world step by step, and finish with a service on the cloud.

Read [Hello Docker](http://jmkhael.hopto.org/hello-docker/) post to quickly get on the train (or whale) then head over to the below.

* Minimal Docker: goes hand in hand with the post [Building and publishing a Docker image](http://jmkhael.hopto.org/building-and-publishing-a-docker-image/) where we will build our first Docker image
* myservice: Read the blog post [Microservice heaven with Docker](http://jmkhael.hopto.org/microservice-heaven-with-docker/) to create your first microservice and begin scaling it.
* hello, world and hello-world: docker services over swarm with rolling upgrades to implement the over engineered version of a hello-world-service which queries a hello-service and a world-service to construct the famous Hello, world.
